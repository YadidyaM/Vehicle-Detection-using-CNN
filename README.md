# Vehicle Detection Using CNN

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect vehicles in images. The trained model is capable of distinguishing between vehicles and non-vehicles within an image.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust vehicle detection system using deep learning techniques. By leveraging CNNs, the model learns to identify features unique to vehicles and can accurately classify them in images.

## Dataset

We employed a comprehensive dataset consisting of images containing various types of vehicles as well as non-vehicle objects. The dataset was meticulously curated and annotated to ensure high-quality training data.

## Model Architecture

Our CNN architecture is designed to effectively extract discriminative features from input images. It comprises multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers for feature extraction and spatial downsampling. The final layers consist of fully connected layers for classification.

## Training

The model was trained using a combination of image augmentation techniques and optimization algorithms to enhance generalization and convergence speed. Extensive experiments were conducted to fine-tune hyperparameters and improve overall performance.

## Evaluation

We evaluated the model's performance using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we conducted qualitative assessments to assess its robustness in real-world scenarios.

## Results

The trained model demonstrates promising results, achieving high accuracy rate of 99% in detecting vehicles and non vehicles. We provide visualizations and examples to showcase its efficacy in real-world scenarios.
